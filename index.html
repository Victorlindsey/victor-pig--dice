          <h2>Rules of Pig Dice</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Two dice: two dice are rolled instead of one</li>
              <li>Any number of dice ("Hog" variation): the player rolls only once per turn with an arbitrary number of dice.</li>
                <li>  6 is bad: a roll of 6 is treated as a roll of 1.</li>

        <h3>About pig Dice</h3>
        <p>Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

    If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
    If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
    If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

The first player to score 100 or more points wins.</p>
